# Interactive-India-Amazon-Sales-Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing Amazon data. It was built as part of my data visualization work using Tableau.
I have used Amazon’s Online Sales data for 4 months – from March 2022 to June 2022.

In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, data-driven insights play a crucial role in optimizing business operations, enhancing customer satisfaction, and driving revenue. This analysis delves into the sales performance, shipment trends, and regional demand across various states, product categories, and time periods. By leveraging data visualization, I aim to uncover patterns, identify areas for improvement, and provide strategic recommendations to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience.

This dashboard is designed to provide valuable weekly sales insights to stakeholders involved in category management, planning, and marketing strategy.

**Category Managers** → To track sales performance trends and identify top- or under-performing product lines over time.

**Marketing Teams** → To align promotional campaigns with peaks and dips in category demand.

**Inventory & Demand Planners** → To forecast demand accurately and ensure optimal stock levels based on category trends.
